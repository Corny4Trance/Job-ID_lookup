# Job-ID_lookup
Lookup the Job-IDs of your Applicant Tracking System from within Jobboards

Jobboards tend to post detailed job ads a level below a listing overview. On the detailed post one will usually find the apply link. The script harvests from the detailed pages the apply links and replace the jobboard default overview list with a simple table containing all Job-IDs together with job titles and posting IDs.
That way you can copy the list an further compute it with your favorite spreadsheet program.

The scripts are written to be used with Greasemonkey. The have not been tested on other user script tools.
